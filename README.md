# 8T-SRAM_CELL
The design and implementation of the 8T-SRAM Cell done by me was a part of an amazing initive i.e. Cloud-based Analog Design Hackathon jointly conducted by IIT Hyderabad, VSD and Synopsys.
The whole process took place on Synopsys tool and the design implementation was done on 28nm PDK (Process Design Kit) [here](quora.com/profile/Ashish-Kulkarni-100)
