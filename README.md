# 8T-SRAM_CELL
The design and implementation of the 8T-SRAM Cell done by me was a part of an amazing initive i.e. [Cloud-based Analog Design Hackathon](https://www.iith.ac.in/events/2022/02/15/Cloud-Based-Analog-IC-Design-Hackathon/)  jointly conducted by IIT Hyderabad, VSD and Synopsys.
The whole process took place on Synopsys tool and the design implementation was done on 28nm PDK (Process Design Kit)
